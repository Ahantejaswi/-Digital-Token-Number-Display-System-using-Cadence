Associated with RV College Of Engineering

Implemented a digital bank token number display using digital circuits in the Cadence Virtuoso tool.

The display will count from 00 to 99 using a cascaded 4-bit up counter.

The design includes various logic gates, a JK flip-flop, and a 7-segment decoder to display the count on a common cathode 7-segment display
